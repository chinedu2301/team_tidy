"Data Scientist","IBM","Austin, TX","Introduction

As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities

We are in a data science renaissance.

Companies that embrace data science will lead and those who do not will fall behind.

To help IBM's clients lead, we are building a team of data science practitioners to help them learn how to succeed with data science. The team will include data engineers, machine learning engineers, operations research / optimization engineers and data journalists.

The team will engage directly in solving real-world data science problems in a wide array of industries around the globe with IBM clients and internally to IBM. The team of data scientist will work with other IBMers and client data science teams to solve problems in banking, insurance, health care, manufacturing, oil & gas and automotive industries, to name a few.  

We will teach the data scientists and sometimes people who desire to be data scientist to:

Key Responsibilities


Identify a use case
Break that use case down into discrete MVPs (minimal viable product)
Work in code notebooks
Build & validate models
Deploy models via APIs into applications or workflows
Monitor & retrain models
Use code repositories to version and share code/notebooks
Visualize the output of their data story in a way that is consumable by all
Create Machine Learning pipelines and train models.
Communicate effectively with line-of-business end-users to discover pain points and use cases, lead project definitions, and convey the business value of the project


While working across all these industries, you will also get to travel as these engagements may require that the team spend several weeks at client sites working on data science problems with a diverse team.
