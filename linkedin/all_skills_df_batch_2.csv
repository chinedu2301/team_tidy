Drive innovation by exploring new statistical techniques and brainstorming ways to optimize the existing forecast infrastructure and make processes even better
Apply Agile principles via participating in standups, sprint planning, writing business requirements documents, and retrospectives
Collaborate with data engineers, developers, and business analysts
Design, develop, or improve new user-friendly web applications supporting data science products, contributing to our vision for a “one-stop shop” forecasting interface
Develop and deploy testing hypotheses and analyze results, providing the necessary analytical rigor to ensure data quality, consistency, repeatability, and accuracy of insights

High proficiency in SQL and Python (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) for data analysis;
Experience designing and implementing predictive models (generalized linear models, time series, etc.);
Experience working with Git;
Proven sense of responsibility and effective project ownership – you have an aptitude for troubleshooting complex problems with creative solutions;

Dig into the drivers of change when interpreting forecasts and build visualizations/interfaces to share results with business stakeholders in an easily digestible, sustainable, and automated manner
Ensure data is as clean as possible and a reliable source of truth, escalating anomalies and developing workarounds where needed
Drive innovation by exploring new statistical techniques and brainstorming ways to optimize the existing forecast infrastructure and make processes even better
Apply Agile principles via participating in standups, sprint planning, writing business requirements documents, and retrospectives
Collaborate with data engineers, developers, and business analysts
Design, develop, or improve new user-friendly web applications supporting data science products, contributing to our vision for a “one-stop shop” forecasting interface
Develop and deploy testing hypotheses and analyze results, providing the necessary analytical rigor to ensure data quality, consistency, repeatability, and accuracy of insights
Participate in an “Open Source” learning environment where sharing, documenting, teaching, and collaborating with others is the culture


Basic Qualifications:


High proficiency in SQL and Python (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) for data analysis;
Experience designing and implementing predictive models (generalized linear models, time series, etc.);
Experience working with Git;
Proven sense of responsibility and effective project ownership – you have an aptitude for troubleshooting complex problems with creative solutions;
Communication skills – you’re able to shift between technical and non-technical terminology depending on the audience;
Natural curiosity - you enjoy digging deeper to find the big picture and are open to learning new technologies;
User/Client Oriented – you have strong interpersonal skills, building relationships across teams and functions to earn trust and advance business goals;
Comfort with messy data and flexibility in dynamic environments.
