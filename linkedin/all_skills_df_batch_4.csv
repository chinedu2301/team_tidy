Understanding of software development lifecycle

Experience working with Python and other data science tools

The ability to effectively communicate technical ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences

Familiarity with databases and data retrieval, including SQL

Hands-on experience with AWS or other similar cloud services

A passion for data and technology







Day-to-Day *

Our entertainment client is looking to bring on a Sr. Data Analyst. Their relevance engine is going to be rolled out across several new use cases over the next few months. As such, they need an experienced machine learning expert to help build, validate, and deploy new models right away. Their recommender is also in need of additional support once it launches in September and will need to be loaded up with new and innovative models shortly after its recent launch. Their current resources are already loaded up with the present workload and they won’t be able to give this the attention it needs. Many of our junior resources need too much coaching from senior team members, so we really need someone who can jump in and contribute right away, not a year from now. In addition, because these models are iterative, we need someone who can be involved long term and build upon previous models. Areas of responsibility may include, but are not limited to:

Performing innovative research on content delivery optimization

Translating business problems into an actionable data science project

Presenting analyses and models in a clear, easy to understand manner

Developing, deploying, and supporting ML/AI models

Building reports and real-time dashboards for our stakeholders

Developing statistical experiments and analyzing the results

Process, cleanse, and verify the integrity of data

Day-to-Day *

Our entertainment client is looking to bring on a Sr. Data Analyst. Their relevance engine is going to be rolled out across several new use cases over the next few months. As such, they need an experienced machine learning expert to help build, validate, and deploy new models right away. Their recommender is also in need of additional support once it launches in September and will need to be loaded up with new and innovative models shortly after its recent launch. Their current resources are already loaded up with the present workload and they won’t be able to give this the attention it needs. Many of our junior resources need too much coaching from senior team members, so we really need someone who can jump in and contribute right away, not a year from now. In addition, because these models are iterative, we need someone who can be involved long term and build upon previous models. Areas of responsibility may include, but are not limited to:

Performing innovative research on content delivery optimization

Translating business problems into an actionable data science project

Presenting analyses and models in a clear, easy to understand manner

Developing, deploying, and supporting ML/AI models

Building reports and real-time dashboards for our stakeholders

Developing statistical experiments and analyzing the results

Process, cleanse, and verify the integrity of data

Participating in data validation efforts
