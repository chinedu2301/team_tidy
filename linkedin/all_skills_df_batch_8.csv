Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Impact Healthcare

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Impact Healthcare

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

As a Data Scientist, you are responsible for conceptualizing, planning and executing advanced analytics projects to discover key insights improving NAVIFY product portfolio leading to better and more efficient patient care. The data you will be working with is varied in type including - but not limited to – clinical patient-level data, supplemented with data such as omics, imaging, digital health, etc. You will collaborate with peers within the function and across the organization to develop and improve existing Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and workflow solutions, improve product support strategies, identify evidence gaps and data sources, design and execute studies, and implement analyses to support improvement of existing products and drive discovery and early development of new features or apps to drive the NAVIFY portfolio.

In this position, you will also ensure that the design, execution, and presentation of analytical results are adhering to industry standards and potentially improve and redefine current industry standards. In order to succeed you will leverage and expand knowledge of available healthcare data sources and applicable state-of-the-art analytical methodologies, large scale data processing and visualization, and languages and tools (R, Python, SQL, Hadoop, Spark, etc.). In addition, you will rely on your scientific expertise, strong advanced analytical skills, and your ability to interact with cross-functional experts such as biostatisticians, epidemiologists, product owners and oncologists, to discover novel insights demonstrating impact of various treatment decisions, and uncover key elements leading to best outcomes for patients.

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Impact Healthcare

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions. 

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.
